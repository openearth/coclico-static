            <a href="https://coclicoservices.eu/partners/" target="_blank">CoCliCo partners</a> and stakeholders 
            to inform users on present-day and future coastal risks, with the goal to improve decision-making on 
            risk management and adaptation.

          <h3 class="mt-4 font-italic">Terms of Use</h3>
          <p>
            The CoCliCo web platform (available at 
            <a href="https://platform.coclicoservices.eu/" target="_blank">https://platform.coclicoservices.eu/</a>) 
            was built and is currently managed by Stichting Deltares. The use of the platform is subject to the 
            terms and conditions as described in 
            <a href="https://www.deltares.nl/en/disclaimer" target="_blank">https://www.deltares.nl/en/disclaimer</a>. 
            By visiting and using the CoCliCo web platform you acknowledge that you have read and agreed to these terms.

            All datasets within CoCliCo are licensed with Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY-4.0),

          <p>
            Special attention needs to be paid to the results presented in the platform. These reflect policy-based
            protection standards aggregated at the provincial (NUTS2) level, based on the coastal defence database
            developed within the project. In some regions, such as the North-sea coastline in Germany, no precise
            value of protection standard was found and only the flood map without explicitly incorporating defenses
            has been computed. Further research may update coastal flooding scenarios using updated protection standards.
